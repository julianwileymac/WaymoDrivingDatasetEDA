# Autonomous Driving EDA - Waymo Open Driving Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the [Waymo Open Dataset](https://www.waymo.com/open) using Python and Dash. The Waymo Open Dataset is a large-scale collection of high-resolution sensor data collected from autonomous vehicles developed by Waymo. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the real-world challenges faced by autonomous vehicles and explore various aspects of autonomous driving technology.

The primary goals of this EDA project are as follows:

1. **Data Understanding**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the Waymo Open Dataset, including its structure, available data types, and relevant metadata. Explore the different sensor modalities captured, such as LiDAR, radar, and camera.

2. **Data Exploration**: Perform exploratory data analysis on the Waymo Open Dataset to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the sensor data. This includes visualizing and analyzing the spatial, temporal, and semantic aspects of the dataset.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features from the raw sensor data that can be used for downstream tasks, such as object detection, motion prediction, and scene understanding. This may involve transforming, filtering, or aggregating the sensor data.

4. **Visualization**: Develop interactive visualizations using Python Dash to present the findings of the EDA. Dash provides a web-based framework for creating interactive dashboards, allowing users to explore the dataset and gain insights intuitively.

## Methodology

The following steps will be followed to conduct the EDA project:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download and preprocess the Waymo Open Dataset using the provided Python libraries and utilities. This step involves setting up the necessary dependencies and obtaining the dataset from the official sources.

2. **Data Exploration**: Perform initial data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and contents. This includes analyzing the available data types, examining the metadata, and identifying potential challenges or limitations.

3. **Visualization Development**: Utilize the Python Dash framework to create interactive visualizations that enable users to explore the dataset. These visualizations may include 2D and 3D representations of the sensor data, time-series analysis, and statistical summaries.

4. **Feature Extraction**: Apply feature engineering techniques to extract relevant information from the sensor data. This step may involve transforming raw sensor measurements into more interpretable formats or deriving higher-level features from the raw data.

5. **Analysis and Interpretation**: Analyze the extracted features and conduct statistical analyses to uncover patterns, correlations, and other insights related to autonomous driving. This step may involve comparing different sensor modalities, evaluating sensor fusion techniques, or examining the dataset's performance on specific tasks.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document the entire EDA process, including data preprocessing steps, visualization development, feature engineering techniques, and analysis results. This documentation will serve as a reference for future work and facilitate knowledge sharing.
